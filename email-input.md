I have been busy.
I am halfway through a certificate in [_Futures Studies and Speculative Design_](https://cpe.newschool.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&certificateId=1408175), and making progress on this [_Little Free Solar Library_](https://sparklelabs.com/journal/little-free-solar-library-first-post/).

In other news, I am searching for a role like **Lead Creative Technologist or Product Designer for a stage B+ company in eduTech or hardware/robotics**. Please ping me if you think of someone I should talk to, or hear of a position.

Here is the new **[portfolio](https://arielchuri.sparklelabs.com)**.  

Also, I am trying to be more social. Any short chats would be great! ([_Calendly_](https://calendly.com/arielchuri/30min)).

Carry on,
